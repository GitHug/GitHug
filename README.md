Hi 👋 

I'm a Software Engineer with extensive experience of contracting. I have previously worked for [uniQode](https://q.group/offices/uniqode) and Capgemini, however since May 2019 I run my own businesses, [Takanoha Limited](https://takanoha.io/) and [Takanoha Ab](https://takanoha.ax). I currently live in [Mariehamn, Finland](https://goo.gl/maps/3qLt7SXYnGhPUGvm7) 🇦🇽 🇫🇮.

⚡ Fun fact: Those familiar with Scandinavia would likely recognize my last name as very Finnish. I'm absolutely terrible at Finnish, even though I spent many years in primary school trying to learn it. Swedish is alright though.

🌱 I’m currently learning: AWS and distributed systems in general 🤯

📖 I'm currently reading: Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppman.

### Hobbies
I have been a Warhammer enthusiast for the last 20 years now. I don't have as much time for it as I used to, but I do try to get a game in at least once per month 🎲. I also try to paint and build some kits when I have some time over, trying to chip away at my embarrassingly large backlog 🖌️.

I also like to work on hobby projects 🖥️. They are mainly designed for learning and keeping my skills sharp. You can find a selection of my hobby projects below 👇.
